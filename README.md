# Movie-Recommender-System-Content-Based-and-Deep-Learning-Approaches
Deep Learning with TensorFlow Recommenders
This approach uses TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) to build a multi-objective recommendation model that considers both ratings and movie retrieval. Key components include:
Data Preparation: Creates TensorFlow datasets from the movie and rating data.
Model Definition: Defines a TFRS model with separate user and movie embedding layers and a rating prediction model.
Model Training: Trains the model using a combined loss function that considers both rating prediction and movie retrieval tasks.
Recommendation Generation: Uses the trained model to generate movie recommendations for specific users and predict ratings for user-movie pairs.
